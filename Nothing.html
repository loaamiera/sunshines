                My  brain 
                <br>
                is  muted.
                <br>
                I  think
                <br>
                as    slow    as    I    write.
                <br>
                I have an original thought
                <br>
                as often as I feel inspiration.
                <br>
                I can never verbalize
                <br>
                whatâ€™s in my mind
                <br>
                and so I can never write beautifully.
