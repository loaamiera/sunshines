                Once I dreamed 
                <br>
                of Neptune— it seemed 
                <br>
                I could tell from his hue and armor.
                <br>
                It’s clear to keen,
                <br>
                who know dead can dream,
                <br>
                that others might visit my head too.
                <br>
                He raked and racked 
                <br>
                through my brain and laughed 
                <br>
                for my smartest cell was ordinary.
                <br>
                It stung like slap,
                <br>
                and he wanted that, 
                <br>
                for he analyzed me as he sat. 
                <br>
                He joked like friend 
                <br>
                and I ignored then 
                <br>
                that he was fishing for details of mine. 
                <br>
                He then got up,
                <br>
                gave me gossip and stuff,
                <br>
                and spread my information online.
