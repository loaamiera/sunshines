            <p>
                Yesterday night
                <br>
                my mom was asleep in her room,
                <br>
                as her unwelcomed boyfriend
                <br>
                broke down the door
                <br>
                I had unlocked and locked
                <br>
                three times before bed.
                <br>
                <br>
                In the dream I was having,
                <br>
                he rubbed his dirty fingers 
                <br>
                all over my body,
                <br>
                mumbling that he needed to stick his dick in something,
                <br>
                like he complained
                <br>
                in real life.
                <br>
                <br>
                He put a pistol to my head
                <br>
                and told me to get on my knees
                <br>
                and pulled the trigger
                <br>
                as I said no.
                <br>
                <br>
                The gunshot mixed
                <br>
                with the sound of his first step
                <br>
                on the hardwood floor
                <br>
                as he dizzily stumbled his way
                <br>
                to my motherâ€™s room
                <br>
                and I woke up.
                <br>
                <br>
                I laid still as metal
                <br>
                as I strained my ears for any sound of fight
                <br>
                but she only slept
                <br>
                as he smoked her cigarettes.
                <br>
                for nutrition.
