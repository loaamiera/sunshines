                You ate your words and now your stomach hurts.
                <br>
                How does it feel to be me?
                <br>
                Victim complexes will never work,
                <br>
                now don’t you just want to flee?
                <br>
                The letters sit at the pit of your stomach,
                <br>
                do you know how much it fills me with glee?
                <br>
                Because you ate your words and your stomach hurts,
                <br>
                and now you know what it’s like to be me.
