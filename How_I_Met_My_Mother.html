            <p>
                I was always been a curious child.
                <br>
                I wanted to know why the clouds moved,
                <br>
                why boys made my stomach burn.
                <br>
                It was always raining,
                <br>
                and I wanted to know why for that too.
                <br>
                My mom told me that that's just how God works.
                <br>
                But when it rained, she poured,
                <br>
                <br>
                her skin melting into the sheets of the bed.
                <br>
                Who knows the last time they had been changed,
                <br>
                or that she had bathed.
                <br>
                Often I would join,
                <br>
                my body feeling heavier by each passing minute.
                <br>
                I wanted to know why god would do that to us.
                <br>
                <br>
                Her husband would stumble home drunk near midnight,
                <br>
                and maybe she would get up,
                <br>
                or move her eyes away from that one stain on the ceiling,
                <br>
                but I was not allowed to be too happy to see him.
                <br>
                I wanted to know why she did that too.â€‹
                <br>
                <br>
                And when the sun was out, she burst.
                <br>
                She shined brighter than a supernova.
                <br>
                In the mornings,
                <br>
                she was the grass and the wind and the trees,
                <br>
                buzzing around to the neighbors by 11,
                <br>
                two adderall in her system,
                <br>
                selling her narcotics,
                <br>
                with me in the back seat.
                <br>
                <br>
                I wanted to know what the difference between 15s and 30s were.
                <br>
                <br>
                In the afternoon would come the beratings,
                <br>
                leaving me to bang my head against the wall,
                <br>
                and my fist against my head.
                <br>
                I wanted to know why we hated me too.
