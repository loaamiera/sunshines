                Cry at my funeral
                <br>
                for the pain that I have caused.
                <br>
                Wear black
                <br>
                to soak up the dread of seeing my rubbered face.
                <br>
                The priest sips from a flask
                <br>
                as he gives his praising speech.
                <br>
                He begged to have me buried in the most expensive casket
                <br>
                in belief that its the only way to add worth to my soul.
