            <p>
            I wish I never met you
            <br>
            Im tossing and turning
            <br>
            I really hope you are too
            <br>
            Hope your heart is yearning
            <br>
            For at last, me to touch you
            <br>
            I miss the way your smile
            <br>
            Would give me so much faith 
            <br>
            And how you'd run for miles 
            <br>
            To put the same one on my face 
            <br>
            And as I write every line
            <br>
            I happen to be dreaming
            <br>
            Of a world where we exist
            <br>
            And so tonight as I lay
            <br>
            On my pillow of tears
            <br>
            I will go ahead and pray
            <br>
            That I won't let you back in
            </p>
