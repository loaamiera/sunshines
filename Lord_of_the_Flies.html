                Rule one, do no harm.
                <br>
                Rule two, worship money the most.
                <br>
                Rule three, 
                <br>
                donâ€™t steal fire from the mountain.
                <br>
                <br>
                Let it burn burn burn.
                <br>
                Let it take the vines
                <br>
                the animals
                <br>
                and the children.
                <br>
                <br>
                Because, because, because...
                <br>
                fire brings light to the dark.
                <br>
                So that we can see 
                <br>
                there is no beast.
                <br>
                Unless we get frightened of people.
                <br>
                Who here is frightened of people?
