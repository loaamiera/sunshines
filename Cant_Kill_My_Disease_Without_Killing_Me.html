        “No matter if I ever got out of this depression alive, it made no difference because it had already fundamentally changed me. There had been permanent damage. My morose character would not ever go away because depression was everything about me. It colored every aspect of me so thoroughly, and I became resigned to that.”

            There’s a profound sadness swarming my soul 
            <br>
            Something bigger than you and me
            <br>
            I think, maybe I can cut it out
            <br>
            I think, maybe I can purge it out 
            <br>
            I think, maybe I can cry it out 
            <br>
            Maybe I can kill it from the source.
